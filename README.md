Job Order System for SBMA-PPMD

A Job Order System for Procurement and Property Management Department of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority. During my internship in this department I was able to create a job order system that made their job easy and they are currently using right now, the system was able to turn their traditional paper way to digital.

The system is LAN based, stores the job order of 5 different section, it automatically generates JO number so they can track the job of each member of the department, the system is able to generate specific reports that can be export to excel file or pdf file. The system helps each supervisor of 5 sections to keep track of the work progress of their section while the admin section can keep track and control the whole division.

Developed using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and MYSQL.
